  <h1>Reflection</h1>
  <p>At first I wanted to have the different pictures as backgrounds for my left side menu, so there would be both text and images on the menu. I could not figure out how to accomplish this so i went with a simple gold background instead and a black text. Another challenge going from the wireframe to the website was to get the main picture to be correct size and not interfare with my right side Reflections menu. I went with an option to limit the width of the main picture to 55% of viewport width, and trying out different values to see what looked best with my right menu. This would result in the picture being gradually zoomed out and then at a certain size begin to cut into the picture to not end up with a picture that is too small. Then when the screen would become small enough to be more fit for a phone the picture would be the scale of 100% originally, then start to cut again following the pixel size of the screen. In a phone layout the picture will then be below the originally left side menu. The main challenges when implementing the page with regards to its responsive nature was getting the elements to line up and not collide at the beginning. Also a big challenge at the beginning was knowing how to make the CSS elements change when reaching a certain resolution, like a phone resolution. Then when looking more into it it got very easy when finding the @media function for when my screen reaches a certain pixel width threshold. I went with the <img> to change the size of the picture based on the users current resolution.</p>
